# Worked Example — /prospect run · AGRICULTURE × MAHARASHTRA · August 2026

> Mined before the v1.5.1 software-native gate existed. Checked retroactively: all
> three wedges below already comply — WhatsApp/IVR bots and a phone-camera capture app
> are pure software with existing-device inputs, no fabrication. Nothing to redo.

> A real run of the problem-prospector method with live web mining. Study the SHAPE:
> every problem below was **mined** from institutional evidence (audits, assembly replies,
> court orders, procurement docs, grievance dashboards, shutdown postmortems) — not
> brainstormed. Every claim carries a URL; items not traceable to a primary document are
> labelled [UNVERIFIED]. Figures quoted as stated in the cited source (verify freshness
> before submitting — evidence rots).

## B · Triangulated candidates (6 survived the gates)

relief (4-yr recurrence) · C3 PMFBY premium-in/payout-out gap + mass-rejection pendulum ·
C4 manual panchnama throttles compensation · C5 MSP centres open after distress-sales ·
C6 sugar-mill effluent proven only via years of NGT litigation.
(C3 died at solvability — the bleeding link isn't outsider-buildable in 36h; C5 thin
software surface; C6 narrow population.)

## C · Top 3 (full dossier treatment)

### 🥇 C1 — "Why is my paisa stuck?" — the eKYC/land-record gate
- **Severity:** ₹60.8 cr / 70,793 farmers stranded in ONE district; 5,00,000 facing
  loan-waiver exclusion; 2.31 lakh can't get Farmer IDs (7/12 mismatches); 88.32% of
  national agri grievances = "instalment stopped". **Recurrence:** 2023/2025/2026 — structural.
- **Failed attempt:** AgriStack Farmer Registry was meant to clean the pipe; it became
  the new choke point, failing silently at the land-record layer — eligible farmers get
  zero and never learn why. **Pain owner:** Tehsildar/Collector + Agriculture Dept.
- **Whitespace:** nobody owns the *diagnostic* layer ("which record do I fix, where").
- **WEDGE (36h):** WhatsApp/IVR bot — farmer sends Farmer-ID/survey no. → failure class
  (eKYC pending / bank not seeded / 7-12 name mismatch / mutation pending) → the ONE next
  action + exact office + pre-filled Aaple-Sarkar grievance. Official side: failure-reason
  heat-map per village → targeted eKYC camps. **Rail:** AgriStack/KYS + Aaple Sarkar.
- **Deploy Monday:** pilot with one Collectorate's existing undisbursed list — the pain
  owner literally hands you the users. Metric: % stranded → paid in one cycle.

### 🥈 C4 — Standardised geo-tagged panchnama
- **Severity:** ₹18.92 cr sanctioned yet stuck on assessment (Ahilyanagar); DyCM ordering
  panchnamas "without waiting"; NGT ordering an SOP be *created*. Every rain event, 3 years.
- **WEDGE:** field-capture app for Talathis — GPS+timestamp+photo+crop, area auto-pulled
  from 7/12 → tamper-evident standardised damage record flowing into the relief proposal.
  **Rail:** the Revenue Dept's own field staff (distribution = government workforce).
- **Procurement path already funded:** the state's own hackathon + AIAIC ₹2 cr pilots
  repost this exact need.

### 🥉 C2 — Onion distress-sale early-warning + procurement slotting
- **Severity:** −71% price crash; ₹10,000 cr claimed loss; relief structurally late +
  below cost. Strongest recurrence in the set (4 consecutive years).
- **Whitespace nuance:** price DISCOVERY is covered (Agmarknet/eNAM) — the open gap is
  relief TIMING/targeting. **WEDGE:** crash-threshold trigger on APMC feeds → WhatsApp/IVR
  alert to growers with nearest NAFED/NCCF slot + booking; agency heat-map of arrival
  spikes. Framed honestly as triage, not cure (the real fix is policy).

## Method takeaways (why this beats a ChatGPT problem list)

1. The winning problem (C1) is invisible to brainstorming — it lives in the gap BETWEEN
   schemes, visible only where grievance %, assembly replies, and district news triangulate.
2. The graveyard law shaped every wedge: ride a rail that already holds the user.
3. Procurement mining proved demand: the state has budgeted ₹500 cr trying to buy what
   these wedges do — a self-proposed PS with a named funded buyer is judge catnip.
4. Total run: ~4 hours of agent mining. Evidence rots — re-verify figures before submission.
